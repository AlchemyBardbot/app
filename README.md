# Mission Statement
Bardbot allows game masters to create an immersive environment within discord utilizing music and sound effects with only a few keystrokes. 


# Group Agreement
- Scrums: First thing in the morning, right before lunch, right before leaving.
- Do not struggle for more than 15 minutes before asking for help
- If conflict arises, ask for an arbiter
- If conflict is just personal, keep it professional
- No one works over night or on the weekend without letting the rest of the group know
- Take proper breaks, let others know so they can remember to take breaks
- Be constructive with feedback and opinions. Don't just say "I don't like that", say "I don't like that, and here's my suggestion for how to do it instead"
- Be open minded to suggestions and openly communicate
